A demo for an idea I had. I used to volunteer with an animal shelter that used a software called BetterImpact to manage volunteer shifts and manage other shelter tasks. It was slow, a bit old, and I felt I could make something better. This was the child of those dreams. 
Sadly, they shut down just a few months later.
